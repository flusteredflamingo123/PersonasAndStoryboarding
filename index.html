        <h1>Personas and Storyboarding</h1>
        <div class = "content">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p> <span class = "bold"> The task: </span> Observe users interacting with a publicly-visible interface. Interview users 
                about their experience and use the data collected to generate two personas and a storyboard representing users of 
                the interface.
                <div><p><span class = "bold">The interface: </span>  A beverage vending machine, sketched below: </p></div>
            </p>
            <div class = "image-and-caption">
                    <img id="sketch" src="VendingMachineSketch.jpg" alt="Sketch of the interface of a vending machine">
                    <p class = "caption">This vending machine interface is designed for users to buy a beverage of their choice with a 
                    variety of payment methods. To get a drink, users must pay using the right panel and then press the button below 
                    their selection.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Collecting Data</h2>
            <p> <span class = "bold"> Observations: </span> I observed three users of the machine, which yielded the following key results:
                <ul>
                    <li>One individual pressed the buttons under multiple items and looked at the display 
                        showing the price of the item.</li>
                    <li>One individual attempted repeatedly to pay with cash, turning a dollar bill over 
                        and rotating it repeatedly before determining that part of the machine was broken.</li>
                    <li>Excluding the events above, all users performed the correct sequence of steps to obtain 
                        a drink from the machine without any real hesitation. There were no other signs of 
                        confusion or frustration.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p> <span class = "bold"> Interview: </span> I asked the observed users the following questions after they interacted 
                with the interface:
                <ol>
                    <li>Did the interface make obvious the steps needed to operate the machine? </li>
                    <li>Did this vending machine’s interface match your expectation of how a vending machine should be operated? 
                        In what ways, if any, did this interface differ from your previous experiences?</li>
                    <li>Did you face any challenges when interacting with the machine that could be solved with a better interface?</li>
                </ol>
                Here is a summary of the users' responses:
                <ul>
                    <li>Users felt that this interface was similar to vending machine interfaces they’ve encountered in the past, 
                        making it clear to them what steps were needed to receive their drink. Some users mentioned that they’ve 
                        used the exact machine many times before, but the process was still intuitive to a user who had not. </li>
                    <li>Potential interface improvements mentioned:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The user who attempted to pay with cash felt that the machine could alert the customer when a payment 
                                option was not operational. </li>
                            <li>The option to pay with Brown card funds could be indicated better.</li>
                            <li>Another user said the drink they received looked slightly different than the image displayed on the 
                                machine, despite being the correct drink. While this was inconsequential to them, they thought that 
                                the actual contents of the machine could be shown to users so they know exactly what to expect. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>
                From the data gathered above, I constructed two personas representing some of the kinds of users who interact with the interface.
            </p>
            <div class = "two-panes">
                <div class = "image-and-caption">
                  <img class = "empathy-map" src="First Year Empathy Map.jpg" alt="An empathy map for the first-year student persona">
                  <p class = "caption">This user is new to campus and thus has not used this machine before. Due to their lack of previous 
                    experience, they are impacted by any unclear or broken elements of the interface. This persona reflects 
                    the potential difficulties and frustrations that new users face.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "image-and-caption">
                    <img class = "empathy-map" src="Routine Empathy Map.jpg" alt="An empathy map for the routine user persona">
                    <p class = "caption">This user buys a beverage from the same vending machine on a regular basis. Getting a drink 
                        could be a small step in a busy day, so the interface should enable them to complete this task quickly. This 
                        persona represents the many users who are returning customers to the vending machine and are already aware of 
                        how the interface operates.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Storyboard</h2>
            <p> Finally, I developed a storyboard illustrating the experience of interacting with the vending machine interface
                for users like the first-year student persona above.</p>
            <div class = "image-and-caption">
                <img id="storyboard" src="Storyboard.JPG" alt="A storyboard illustrating the experience of a first year student 
                interacting with the vending machine interface.">
            </div>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Simply observing users interact with an interface can illuminate flaws in its design.</li>
                <li>Constructing personas to represent different kinds of users helps reveal how an interface captures or fails to capture the needs of various people. </li>
                <li>The process of storyboarding can further highlight the essential components of each kind of user's experience with the interface.</li>
            </ul>
